# Zero-Claw Setup

Interactive setup wizard. Guide the user step by step.

Plugin root is available as `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT`.

## Before Starting

Use TaskCreate to create **all** tasks upfront so the user sees the full picture:

1. "Choose language"
2. "Check prerequisites (tmux, node, pm2)"
3. "Check Telegram plugin"
4. "Create two Telegram bots (main + supervisor)"
5. "Configure Telegram plugin"
6. "Get Telegram user ID"
7. "Collect user info (name, timezone, assistant name)"
8. "Choose working directory"
9. "Generate project files"
10. "Start supervisor"
11. "Introduction & launch"

Mark each task `in_progress` when starting it, `completed` when done.

## Steps

1. **Language**: Ask the user's preferred language. Continue in that language.

2. **Prerequisites**: Check installed tools:
   ```bash
   tmux --version
   node --version
   pm2 --version
   ```
   If anything is missing, tell the user what to install and stop.

3. **Telegram plugin**: Check if the Telegram plugin is installed:
   ```bash
   claude plugins list 2>/dev/null | grep telegram
   ```
   If not installed, run `claude plugins install telegram`.

4. **Create two Telegram bots**: Guide the user to open [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) and create two bots. Explain why two:
   - **Main bot** — your assistant's face, for daily conversation. Suggest names based on the assistant name chosen later (or ask to come back and rename). Username like `myname_bot` or `myname_assistant_bot`.
   - **Supervisor bot** — remote control for when the main bot is unresponsive. Lets you restart, check status, view logs. Username like `myname_supervisor_bot`.
   
   For each bot, tell the user to paste the **entire BotFather response** — parse the token yourself using regex: `/\d+:[A-Za-z0-9_-]{35,}/`. Clearly label which is which when confirming back.

5. **Configure Telegram plugin**: Run `/telegram:configure` and guide the user to paste the **main bot** token to pair the channel.

6. **User ID**: Ask the user to message [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot) on Telegram. They can paste the entire reply — extract the numeric `Id` field yourself.

7. **User info**:
   - **Preferred name**: Ask "How should your assistant address you?" — this is NOT their real name, it's what they want to be called (e.g. "Boss", "Captain", a nickname, a title, or just their first name). Auto-detect their real name from Telegram/system as a suggestion, but let them choose freely.
   - **Timezone**: Ask for timezone (e.g. `Asia/Singapore`). Try to auto-detect from system (`timedatectl` or `TZ` env) and offer as default.
   - **Brief intro** (optional): Ask if there's anything else the assistant should know — role, interests, work context. Keep it short, 1-2 sentences is fine. Can be skipped.
   - **Assistant name**: Ask the user to name their assistant. Suggest 3-5 names from mythology, folklore, or fiction — pick randomly from diverse cultures and pantheons each time (Greek, Norse, Egyptian, Hindu, Chinese, Japanese, Celtic, Mesopotamian, etc.). For each suggestion, give a one-line reason why the name fits an AI assistant (e.g. knowledge, wisdom, communication, protection). Let the user pick one or type their own.

8. **Working directory**: Default to `~/<assistant-name-lowercase>` (e.g. if assistant is "Thoth", default `~/thoth`). Let the user confirm or change.

9. **Generate files** in the working directory:
   - Copy `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/template/CLAUDE.md` → `CLAUDE.md`, fill in all placeholders (assistant name, user name, timezone, language).
   - Copy `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/supervisor/` → `supervisor/`, run `npm install`.
   - Generate `ecosystem.config.cjs` with the collected values. Use `<assistant-name-lowercase>` as the `TMUX_SESSION` name and the **supervisor bot token**.
   - Generate `USER.md` with collected user info (preferred name, timezone, user_id, chat_id, brief intro). This is the assistant's reference for who the user is.
   - Copy `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/start.sh` → `start.sh`, make executable.
   - Create `.claude/memory/MEMORY.md` (empty memory index).
   - Create `.claude/memory/journal/` directory.
   - Initialize git repo. Make sure `.claude/memory/` is **not** gitignored (it must persist across clones).

10. **Start supervisor**: Run `pm2 start ecosystem.config.cjs && pm2 save`.

11. **Introduction & launch**: Before saying goodbye, give the user a brief tour of what their assistant can do:

    **Core capabilities** (built-in):
    - Chat via Telegram — send any message to the main bot
    - Run code, read/write files, search the web — all via natural language
    - MCP tool integration (Gmail, Calendar, Notion, etc. — can be added later)

    **Memory system** (`.claude/memory/`):
    - Your assistant remembers things across sessions — preferences, context, feedback
    - `MEMORY.md` is the index, individual memories are stored as markdown files
    - `journal/` contains daily logs of what happened (maintained by heartbeat)
    - All git-tracked so memory survives machine changes

    **Heartbeat** (automatic):
    - Registered as a cron job on every session start
    - Periodically sends an "online" status to Telegram
    - Reviews conversations and writes notable events to the daily journal
    - End of day: distills journal into long-term memory

    **Supervisor bot** — send `/help` to your supervisor bot to see all commands:
    - `/restart` — restart the assistant when it's stuck
    - `/status` — check if it's running
    - `/logs` / `/screen` — see what's on the terminal
    - `/send <text>` — type into the assistant's terminal

    **How to launch**:
    ```bash
    tmux new-session -s <name> -c ~/<name> './start.sh'
    ```
    Detach: `Ctrl-b d`. Re-attach: `tmux attach -t <name>`.
