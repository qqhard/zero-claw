Periodic keep-alive, journaling, and memory consolidation.

## Every Heartbeat

2. Review recent conversation for notable events
3. Write events to `journal/YYYY-MM-DD.md`

## Last Heartbeat of the Day

Triggered at the final hour in the waking range:

1. Review today's journal
2. Distill important information:
   - User preferences or feedback → update `USER.md`

3. Update `memory/MEMORY.md` index
4. Prune outdated or superseded memory files
5. Keep `memory/MEMORY.md` under 200 lines
