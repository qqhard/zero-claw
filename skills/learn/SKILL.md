# Learn (meta-skill)

Socratic tutoring is **build understanding first, then challenge it — and only challenge when the user is ready.** It is not continuous questioning.

## Three principles (the compass)

1. **ZPD is the main constraint.** Every explanation and every question is pitched at what the user can almost-but-not-quite do on their own. Too easy wastes the turn; too hard shuts them down. Calibrate after **every** answer: precise → +1, half-right → −1, blank → −2.

2. **Map before you teach — but probe before you map.** A good map depends on knowing where the user is and where they want to go. Run a short MCQ probe (Step 1), then draw the dependency map of **4–8 modules** plus a Pareto briefing (Step 2), and get the user to confirm. A wrong map wastes every minute downstream.

3. **Build before challenge (先建后挑).** Default mode is **Build** — explain, scaffold, confirm. Challenge mode (testing, application problems, counterexamples) is **opt-in only**: the user explicitly asks to be tested, or Claude explicitly asks "ready to be tested on this?" and the user agrees. Without an explicit switch, you stay in Build. **This is the single most important discipline in the skill — break it and the skill collapses back into "just asking questions."**

## Six-step workflow

### Step 1 — Multi-round MCQ probe (脑暴)

Before drawing anything, run **3–5 short rounds** of MCQ / yes-no / A-B-C questions to brainstorm the user's goal and current footing. **One question per turn**, each a *different orthogonal dimension* — don't re-ask the same dimension with refined wording. Prefer `AskUserQuestion` so options are explicit; the user can always free-text to elaborate.

Dimensions to pick from (choose 3–5 that actually matter for *this* topic — not all):

- **Goal shape** — solve a specific problem / build a working mental model / full mastery / just curious.
- **Current level** — never heard of it / heard the name / used it a few times / use it regularly.
- **Adjacent knowledge** — pick 3–4 prerequisite concepts and ask which ones the user already has solid.
- **Friction point** — where have they gotten stuck before? (Include a "haven't tried" option so it's not leading.)
- **Delivery preference** — conceptual framing / worked example / code walkthrough / compare-and-contrast with a thing they already know.

**Stop probing when you have enough signal to draw the map.** Two rounds may be enough for a narrow topic; five for a broad one. Never exceed five — that's a sign the topic isn't scoped yet and you should just show a draft map and let the user react.

### Step 2 — Draw the map + Pareto briefing

Two things in one turn:

**(a) Dependency map — 4–8 modules.** One line each. Show dependencies (arrows or indented structure). Mark:
- **Start** — where the probe says we're entering.
- **End** — the user's stated goal or the natural stopping point.

**(b) Pareto briefing — the spark.** A short section that hands the user the high-leverage sketch up front, so they can spot what matters and what to question:

- **The 20% that gives 80%** — 3–5 bullets. The core ideas you'd tell someone in an elevator. These are the load-bearing concepts that will reappear in every module.
- **3 consensuses** — what the field broadly agrees on. Stops the user re-litigating settled material.
- **3 controversies** — what's still debated, where smart people disagree, or where the textbook answer is questionable. Tells the user which parts to hold loosely vs. firmly, and sparks their own exploration.

Present map + briefing together. Ask a single confirmation question: does this shape match what they want, or should we adjust? **Do not proceed without confirmation.**

If `memory/learn/<slug>.md` exists, use last session's map as the starting draft and note what's changed; otherwise create the file after the user confirms.

### Step 3 — Build phase (default mode — most of the session lives here)

For each module on the path from Start → End, teach it. Every module covers three things:
- **What it is** — the definition in plain terms, one concrete example.
- **Why it exists** — the problem it solves, what breaks without it.
- **How it's used** — a minimal use-case the user could reproduce.

Use visible structure (sub-headings, short lists). 6–15 lines per module is normal — a *structured* teach is not a wall of text.

**Only confirmation questions are allowed in Build phase.** OK examples:
- "Does this framing match what you've seen before?"
- "Which of these two sub-parts feels less clear?"
- "Want me to go deeper on the example before moving on?"

**Not allowed in Build:** application problems, "what would happen if...", "predict...", "explain it back to me", counterexamples, anything that *tests* rather than *confirms*. Those belong in Challenge, which requires an explicit mode switch.

### Step 4 — Challenge phase (巩固期 — opt-in only)

Enter Challenge **only** on one of these triggers:
- User says "考我" / "quiz me" / "test me" / "check my understanding" / similar.
- Claude explicitly asks "ready to be tested on [module]?" **and** the user says yes.

In Challenge:
- **Application** — give a new small scenario; ask them to apply the concept.
- **Variant** — same concept, different shape; test structure vs. surface.
- **Counterexample** — a case that looks like it fits but doesn't; ask them to spot why.

One question per turn. After each answer, recalibrate (Step 6). After 3–5 Challenge questions — or when the user signals they're done — return to Build for the next module, unless the user wants to keep testing.

### Step 5 — Scaffolding when stuck (6-level hint gradient)

When the user is stuck on a Challenge question (or a confirmation misfires), escalate **one level per turn**, never skip levels:

1. **Rephrase** — say it differently; maybe they parsed it wrong.
2. **Narrow the scope** — "focus on just the first half" / "ignore the edge case for now."
3. **Point to the relevant module** — "this is about [X] — remember how we framed it?"
4. **Partial structure** — first step, or the shape of the answer, without the content ("it's a two-part answer; the first part is about...").
5. **Key insight** — the single fact or move that unlocks it.
6. **Full answer + diagnose the gap** — complete answer, plus one line on what made it hard.

At each level, pause and let the user try again. **Reaching level 5 or 6 repeatedly is a signal** — see Step 6.

### Step 6 — Calibrate difficulty after every answer

Read the answer, apply the delta, take the action:

| Outcome | Δ difficulty | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Nailed it precisely, no hints | **+1** | Bump difficulty, or advance to the next module |
| Got it with L1–L2 hints | **0** | In the zone — hold and continue |
| Half-right / got it with L3–L4 hints | **−1** | Drop one level; probe the weak sub-part before advancing |
| Blank / only passes with L5–L6 hints, **repeatedly** | **−2** | **Drop two levels: stop, return to Build, re-teach the shaky prerequisite** |

The last row is the critical one. If the user keeps needing "give me the answer" to get through, the **map was wrong or you skipped a module**. Don't push forward. Identify the shaky prerequisite (usually one level up in the map), re-teach, then retry.

Half-right is the common case and the most informative: it tells you exactly which sub-part is shaky. Drop one level and aim the next question at *that* sub-part — don't re-ask the whole thing.

## The default discipline (restate at the top of every session mentally)

**Default = Build.** Mode switch to Challenge requires either:
- User's explicit request ("考我" / "quiz me" / "test me"), or
- Claude's explicit "ready to be tested on [X]?" **and** a yes.

No exceptions. A "just to quickly check, can you predict..." mid-Build turn is a mode violation.

## Per-topic state (optional persistence)

Each topic gets one file at `memory/learn/<topic-slug>.md`. Load on start, update at phase boundaries, save on exit. Keep it tight.

```yaml
---
topic: <display name>
slug: <kebab-case>
created: YYYY-MM-DD
updated: YYYY-MM-DD
map:
  - id: <kebab-case>
    title: <short display name>
    prereqs: [<id>, ...]
    status: untouched | building | built | challenged | shaky
start: <id>          # where the user entered last session
end_goal: <id>       # where they want to arrive
next_module: <id>    # resume point for next session
difficulty: <1–5>    # current ZPD level on next_module
pareto:
  core: [<bullet>, ...]       # the 20%-that-gives-80% bullets
  consensus: [<bullet>, ...]  # 3 agreed-upon
  controversy: [<bullet>, ...] # 3 contested
notes:
  - <one-line observations, e.g. "user strong on set theory, weak on proofs">

```

Do **not** index this file in `memory/MEMORY.md` — it's structured state, not a prose memory. Save at phase boundaries, not every turn.

## Session hygiene

- **Match the user's language** (English or Chinese). Never switch mid-session.
- **Structure beats length.** A teaching turn with visible sub-parts at 10–15 lines is fine. The wall-of-text failure mode is *unstructured* prose, not long prose.
- **One question per turn.** Whether probe (Step 1), confirmation (Build) or challenge (Challenge), never stack two in a single message.
- **Honest uncertainty.** If something is genuinely unsettled, say so — and it's often a candidate for the "3 controversies" list. Don't fabricate a clean answer to keep the flow tidy.
- **No closing summary.** The map, `next_module`, and `difficulty` are the summary. Point at where next session will open, nothing more.

## Anti-patterns

- **Skipping the MCQ probe** and diving straight into a map. You're guessing the user's goal and footing — the map will be wrong and you won't know until Step 4.
- **Endless probing.** More than five rounds in Step 1 means the topic isn't scoped — draft a map and let the user react to it instead.
- **Stacking probes.** Two MCQ questions in one turn violates one-question-per-turn. Each round is its own message.
- **Missing the Pareto briefing.** Handing over a module list without the 3 consensuses / 3 controversies strips out the spark — the user doesn't know which parts are load-bearing, settled, or contested.
- **Slipping into challenge during Build.** "Just quickly, what would happen if..." is a mode violation. Ask a confirmation question or keep teaching; don't sneak a test in.
- **Probing into emptiness.** If the user doesn't know, Build wasn't complete. Return to Build and teach — don't escalate the probe.
- **A map of 15 unconnected concepts.** A map is 4–8 modules with dependencies drawn. Larger than that is a syllabus, not a map — compress or split the topic.
- **Pushing forward when the user is at −2.** Repeated L5–L6 hints mean go back and rebuild, not "just one more hint."
- **Asking "do you understand?"** — always yes, no signal. In Build, ask which sub-part feels cloudy. In Challenge, ask them to restate the key point in their own words.
- Switching languages mid-session.
- Stacking two questions in one turn.
- Indexing `memory/learn/*.md` files in `memory/MEMORY.md` — they're structured state.
