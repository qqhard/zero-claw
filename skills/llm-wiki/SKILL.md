# LLM-Wiki (meta-skill)

Implementation of Karpathy's LLM Wiki pattern (https://gist.github.com/karpathy/442a6bf555914893e9891c11519de94f).

## Core idea

The wiki is a **persistent, compounding artifact** — not re-derived on every query. Three layers:

- **Raw sources** (`<vault>/` minus `_wiki/`): the source collection, **co-maintained by human and bot** (see below). Once a raw note exists, it's treated as source of truth for the wiki compiler — edits to it are rare and deliberate.
- **Wiki** (`<vault>/_wiki/`): LLM-generated, LLM-owned markdown. Summaries, entity pages, concept pages, connections. You read it; the LLM writes it.
- **Schema** (this `SKILL.md`): the conventions and workflows. Co-evolves with the user.

The human curates sources, asks questions, and drives direction. The LLM does the bookkeeping — summarizing, cross-referencing, filing, maintaining consistency — *and*, when warranted, the LLM also promotes its own running context into new raw sources (see "Raw sources: co-maintained"). That's what kills human-maintained wikis: the maintenance burden grows faster than the value. Here it doesn't, because the LLM carries it.

## Raw sources: co-maintained

Karpathy's original pattern treats raw sources as purely human-curated and immutable. We relax that: **raws can originate from either human or bot**.

**Where raws come from**:

- **Human-added** — articles clipped in Obsidian, meeting notes, journal entries, papers, whatever the user drops into the vault. Placed anywhere under `<vault>/` (except `_wiki/`) in whatever structure the user prefers.
- **Bot-captured** — consolidations the bot itself writes to the vault when a running conversation, memory entry, or recurring theme is worth preserving as a durable source. See op §0 Capture.

**Attribution**:

- Use frontmatter `origin:` — `human` (default, may be omitted), `bot`, or `imported` (e.g. web-clip). The bot-written raws carry `origin: bot` and `captured: YYYY-MM-DD` so the user can review them at any time.
- Default directory for bot-captured raws: `<vault>/captured/YYYY/MM/<slug>.md`. If the user's vault already has a folder convention (e.g. `<vault>/notes/` for raws), ask once, record the choice in the vault's `CLAUDE.md` or an adjacent schema note, and follow it thereafter.

**Invariant**: once a raw exists (from either origin), both sides treat it the same — it's compiled into the wiki via Ingest, tracked via `sources:` dep edges, and only edited in rare, deliberate ways. The *origin* is metadata, not a lifecycle distinction.

**Boundary with `evolve`**: `evolve` maintains the bot's own memory (`memory/`, `SOUL.md`, self-skills). `llm-wiki` maintains the shared knowledge vault. When the bot decides something in its private memory has grown to deserve *shared* preservation (durable, queryable, cross-linked), Capture promotes it from `memory/` into the vault — that's where the two skills meet.

## Two navigation files (live in `_wiki/`)

- **`_wiki/index.md`** — content-oriented catalog. Every wiki page listed with a link + one-line summary, grouped by category (concepts, entities, sources). LLM updates on every Ingest. LLM reads **first** on Query to find relevant pages before drilling in.
- **`_wiki/log.md`** — chronological append-only record. Each entry starts with `## [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] <op> | <title>` so `grep "^## \[" _wiki/log.md | tail -20` works. Track ingests, recompiles, non-trivial queries that were filed back, lint passes.

## Our additions on top of Karpathy

Not in the original gist — ours, for an always-on Telegram-bot use case:

- **Co-maintained raws** — bot can Capture durable context into the vault's raw layer, not just Ingest what the user provides.
- **`sources:` dependency edge** in page frontmatter → the `meta.json` Makefile knows which pages go stale when a raw changes.
- **Recompile** op (§2) — incremental invalidation of dirty pages.
- **Maintain** op (§5) — janitor that runs on heartbeat, silent unless something needs attention.
- **BM25 / vector search** via `wiki-search` (analogous to qmd; see §"Enabling vector search").

**Never touch `.wiki-cache/` manually** — scripts own it.
**The `sources:` list is the dep edge.** Without it, Recompile can't invalidate the page.

## Environment

Every operation expects a vault path. Find it from:
1. User-provided path (e.g. `ingest /path/to/vault/notes/x.md`)
2. Current working directory if it contains `_wiki/`
3. Ask the user if neither applies

Scripts live in `<skill>/scripts/`. Run them with `node`.

## Operations

### 0. Capture — promote bot context into a raw source

Use when the bot has accumulated material (chat, journal, memory entry, recurring theme) that deserves to live as a durable raw source in the vault, not just in `memory/`. Capture **writes a new raw .md** and then hands off to Ingest.

**When to Capture** (any of the following):

- The user explicitly says "remember this as a note" / "保存下来" / "记到 wiki 原始区".
- A multi-turn exchange produced a consolidated fact/analysis/decision that you'll want to cite later, and no existing raw or wiki page holds it.
- `evolve` surfaces a recurring topic in journals/memory that has outgrown the bot-private memory format (structured enough to become a source, queryable to the user, worth cross-linking in the wiki).
- The user sends in free-form content ("here's what I've been thinking about X...") and asks to file it.

Do **not** Capture when:

- The material belongs in `memory/`, `SOUL.md`, or a self-skill — that's `evolve`'s scope. Capture is only for vault-worthy content.
- The content is ephemeral or trivially re-derivable.
- A matching raw or wiki page already captures it (extend that instead).

**How to Capture**:

1. Pick destination. Default: `<vault>/captured/<YYYY>/<MM>/<slug>.md`. If the vault has a schema note declaring a different folder for bot-captured content, follow it.
2. Write the raw with frontmatter:
   ```yaml
   ---
   title: <short descriptive title>
   origin: bot
   captured: YYYY-MM-DD
   basis: <one-line what this was distilled from — "chat 2026-04-17" / "memory/foo.md superseded" / "journal pattern over last 7 days">
   ---
   ```
3. Body: the content itself, in prose or structured sections. Don't over-format — Ingest will extract what matters when it compiles this into wiki pages. Aim for a clean, self-contained note someone could read independently.
4. Append to `_wiki/log.md`:
   ```
   ## [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] capture | <title>
   - path: captured/YYYY/MM/slug.md
   - basis: <same as frontmatter>
   ```
5. Immediately proceed to **Ingest** (§1) with the new raw as input. Capture-without-Ingest leaves the wiki untouched; both halves should happen in one motion.
6. Report to the user: what was captured, where it landed, what wiki pages changed as a result. The user can review `captured/` later and delete/edit anything that shouldn't have been saved.

**Size discipline**: one Capture = one focused topic in one file. If the material spans topics, write multiple files. Don't dump an entire chat transcript.

### 1. Ingest `<raw-path>` — compile new source

Self-reference first. You are about to write wiki pages, and the existing wiki is your own prior work — consult it before writing.

1. Read `_wiki/index.md` (if it exists) to see the shape of the existing wiki.
2. `node scripts/wiki-search.mjs <vault> "<topic from raw filename/heading>" --k 10 --json`
   Find pages related to this source.
3. Read the raw note fully. Read the top candidate wiki pages.
4. Decide per candidate page: **new page** vs **extend existing page** vs **split an over-grown page**. Prefer extending over creating. Prefer splitting when a page crosses ~400 words on distinct sub-topics. A single raw source often touches 10-15 wiki pages.
5. Write/edit wiki pages under `_wiki/concepts/`, `_wiki/entities/{people,organizations,tools}/`, or `_wiki/sources/`. Use the frontmatter contract below.
6. For each page you touched:
   - Append the raw path to `sources:` (vault-relative, e.g. `notes/2026/foo.md`). **Required — this is the dep edge.**
   - Add bidirectional `[[links]]` in body and `related:` between this page and any page it references.
   - Bump `updated:` to today.
   - Note contradictions: if a new source contradicts an existing claim on a page, don't silently overwrite — record both and flag which source supports which (brief inline note or a `confidence:` downgrade).
7. Update `_wiki/index.md`: add entries for new pages (link + one-line summary, under the right category). Revise summaries for pages whose scope materially changed. Create the file if missing, using categories: Concepts, Entities (People / Orgs / Tools), Sources.
8. Append to `_wiki/log.md`:
   ```
   ## [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] ingest | <raw-title-or-path>
   - pages: [[Page One]], [[Page Two]]
   - note: <one-line what was added or why>
   ```
   Create the file if missing.
9. Build + stamp + index:
   ```
   node scripts/wiki-graph.mjs <vault>
   for each page you touched: node scripts/wiki-graph.mjs <vault> --stamp <page>
   node scripts/wiki-index.mjs <vault>
   ```
10. Report to user: what pages changed, what links were added, any pages you almost wrote but folded into existing ones, any contradictions flagged.

### 2. Recompile — invalidate dirty pages

Run when the user says "recompile", "the sources changed", or on heartbeat.

1. `node scripts/wiki-graph.mjs <vault>` (refresh raw hashes)
2. `node scripts/wiki-graph.mjs <vault> --diff --json` → `{dirtyPages, orphanSources}`
3. For **each** entry in `dirtyPages`:
   - Read the page + every `source:` it declares (current filesystem content).
   - Rewrite only the sections the sources no longer support. Keep what's still accurate. Add what's new. Preserve `related:` links unless the topic changed.
   - Save the page. Bump `updated:`.
   - Stamp it: `node scripts/wiki-graph.mjs <vault> --stamp <page-rel-path>` — this writes the current raw hashes into the page's `sourceHashes`, clearing the dirty flag.
4. For **orphan sources**: ask the user whether to Ingest them now.
5. `node scripts/wiki-index.mjs <vault>` (re-index changed pages).
6. If a page's scope or one-liner changed, update its entry in `_wiki/index.md`.
7. Append to `_wiki/log.md`:
   ```
   ## [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] recompile | <short reason>
   - pages: [[Page One]], [[Page Two]]
   - sources: notes/a.md, notes/b.md
   ```
8. Final `--diff` should return empty `dirtyPages`. If any remain, you missed stamping.

### 3. Query `<topic>` — look up compiled artifacts

1. Read `_wiki/index.md` first. Often the answer is "this page exists" and you can skip search entirely.
2. If the index didn't resolve it, or you suspect related pages beyond what it lists: `node scripts/wiki-search.mjs <vault> "<topic>" --k 10 --json`
3. Read the top 3-5 candidate pages. Follow `[[links]]` in bodies (= graph traversal) for 1-2 hops when the answer spans pages.
4. Synthesize. Cite which pages you drew from (and any raw sources if you dipped into them).
5. Output format matches the question — a markdown answer, a comparison table, a slide (Marp), a chart, whatever fits.
6. **File valuable synthesis back as a new wiki page** (first-class, not optional). If your answer pieced together an analysis, comparison, or connection that the wiki didn't already have, create a new page for it — the synthesis compounds just like an ingested source. Treat your chat as the raw source; `sources:` points to the original raws you pulled from. Append a `## [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] query | <topic>` entry to `_wiki/log.md` when you file a query back. Skip only when the answer is trivial retrieval (the page already says it).

### 4. Lint

Health-check the wiki. Two layers:

**Mechanical** (script-checkable):
`node scripts/wiki-lint.mjs <vault>` → broken `[[links]]`, islands (no inbound + no outbound), missing frontmatter. Exit code 2 when issues exist — useful for heartbeat gating.

**Semantic** (LLM reads and judges — run when user asks "lint" explicitly):
- Contradictions between pages (page A says X, page B says not-X, both citing sources).
- Stale claims newer sources superseded (page still reflects an older source's view).
- Important concepts mentioned across pages but lacking their own page.
- Missing cross-references (page A mentions concept page B exists for, but doesn't `[[link]]` it).
- Data gaps a web search could fill — surface these as "suggested follow-ups," don't auto-search.

Report both layers together. Ask before fixing.

### 5. Maintain — heartbeat-triggered self-check

Called by a periodic loop (e.g. `skills/heartbeat`), not by the user directly. Keep it quiet: if nothing needs attention, produce no output.

1. `node scripts/wiki-graph.mjs <vault>` (refresh hashes)
2. `node scripts/wiki-graph.mjs <vault> --diff --json`
3. `node scripts/wiki-lint.mjs <vault> --json`
4. Decide:
   - **Dirty pages with few sources (≤ 3) and small raw diffs**: auto-Recompile (per §2). Log.
   - **Dirty pages with many sources or large raw diffs**: surface to user — don't silently rewrite dense pages.
   - **Orphan sources**: never auto-Ingest. Add to a pending list (`_wiki/inbox.md`) — appended, not rewritten — and mention in daily summary.
   - **Broken links**: surface in daily summary; don't fix silently (could mask real drift).
   - **Islands**: surface weekly, not every heartbeat.
5. `node scripts/wiki-index.mjs <vault>` at the end if anything changed.

Principle: Maintain preserves the invariant "the wiki reflects its sources." It doesn't extend scope. Ingest and Query are user-facing; Maintain is janitorial.

## Enabling vector search (one-time per vault)

Vector search is optional. BM25 + `[[link]]` graph traversal is the primary path. Enable vectors when the user mentions semantic search gaps, cross-lingual queries, or finding near-duplicates before Ingest.

When the user asks to enable vectors (or you decide to), check `.wiki-cache/config.json` first:

- If it exists: vectors already enabled — nothing to do.
- If not: ask which embedding model, then run `wiki-index --with-vectors --model <name>`.

Offer these choices, phrased for the user's language:

| choice | model | size | lang |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 (default) | `multilingual-e5-small` | ~120MB | mixed / multilingual |
| 2 | `bge-small-zh-v1.5` | ~95MB | Chinese-heavy |
| 3 | `bge-small-en-v1.5` | ~130MB | English-heavy |

First run triggers a one-time model download to `~/.cache/huggingface/`. Once enabled, `wiki-search` auto-uses hybrid mode. Use `--bm25` to force BM25. To switch models, run `--with-vectors --model <other>` (rebuilds index). To disable, `--no-vectors`.

## Frontmatter contract

```yaml
---
title: 页面标题
type: concept | entity | source-summary
sources:
  - notes/2026/foo.md          # vault-relative, required dep edges
  - notes/2026/bar.md
related:
  - "[[Other Page Title]]"     # optional, mirrors body [[links]]
updated: 2026-04-16
confidence: high | medium | low   # optional
---
```

- `sources:` is the truth table for the compiler. Missing sources → the page can't be invalidated when raw changes → stale wiki.
- `related:` is informational; the body's `[[links]]` are what lint actually checks.

## Conventions

- Page filenames: kebab-case, ASCII when possible (`incremental-compilation.md`, not `增量编译.md`). `title:` frontmatter holds the display name.
- `[[links]]` resolve by page `title:`, not filename. Be consistent — lint will flag drift.
- When a concept is a person/org/tool, put it under `_wiki/entities/`, not `_wiki/concepts/`.
- Keep pages under ~400 words; split when they grow.
- Never edit `.wiki-cache/` by hand.

## Anti-patterns

- Forgetting `sources:` → dep edge invisible → Recompile can't find the page.
- Editing a wiki page to add new facts without touching `sources:` → `sources:` lies about which raws back the page.
- Rewriting a whole page when one section changed → wasteful; edit the affected section.
- Creating a new page when an existing one would do (silent duplication).
- Forgetting to update `_wiki/index.md` on Ingest → future queries miss the page.
- Capturing without Ingesting → raw file sits in `captured/` and never makes it into the compiled wiki; the point of Capture is the round-trip.
- Capturing content that belongs in `memory/` / `SOUL.md` / self-skills instead → that's `evolve`'s scope, not the vault. Capture is only for durable, shareable source material.
- Bulk-dumping a chat transcript as a single Capture → one file per focused topic, not one file per session.
- Letting valuable Query synthesis live only in chat → exploration doesn't compound, and you'll re-derive the same answer next week.
- Copying raw source text wholesale into wiki pages → wiki becomes a mirror, not a synthesis. Summarize, connect, cite back.
- Silently overwriting a claim when a new source contradicts an old one → record both, let the user (or a later pass) decide.
- Confusing `_wiki/index.md` (human-readable content catalog) with `wiki-index.mjs` (BM25/vector search script). They're different tools.
- Running `wiki-index` without first running `wiki-graph` — the search index reads stale meta.
